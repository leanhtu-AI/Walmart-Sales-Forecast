# Walmart-Sales-Forecast

## Description

This is a project about the application of data science to sales-forecast problems. With the scope as the capstone for the student at university, my team and I have been working for about one month to finish it.

The data I have collected for my project comes from a competition organized by Walmart in 2014. Now it has been published in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting)

You can see more details our workflow (such as the method we use to solve problem, the obstacle that we have met...) in our pdf file names "Dap301m-Report"

## Installation

Use the file name "requirements.txt" to install the needed library

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to use

After the installation step, you can reproduce our result when go to the "Data-Centric" folder and run the notebooks called "Top_40 Kaggle" on your terminal.

You also can see other notebooks with the output already shown below each code.
